### Advanced Next Word Prediction using LSTM, GRU & Hybrid Attention Models

This repository implements an **advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) project** for **Next Word Prediction** using deep learning.  
The system is built using **LSTM, GRU, and a Hybrid LSTM–GRU architecture with Attention**, trained on *Shakespeare’s Hamlet*.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Text preprocessing with tokenization and sequence padding
- Attention-based **LSTM** model
- Attention-based **GRU** model
- **Hybrid LSTM + GRU + Attention** model (rare & advanced)
- Temperature-based next word prediction
- Modular training and inference scripts
- Clean, reproducible project structure
